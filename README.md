# py-core
Pounce lang aimed at running on microPython or circuitPython. The code is just for experimentation with Joy-lang contatinative code on a microprocessor.

Although py-core is limited in speed, this interpretor has the advantage that it fits inside the large ecosystem of hardware specific libraries for interfacing with sensors, actuators as well as being portable to a growing variety of microprocessor and dev boards. Otherwise see pounce-lang/c-core for an interpretor that is a little closer to the metal (note that in the future the c-core may be built as a python module. That would combine the faster c-core for use in the capable and varied python environments).
